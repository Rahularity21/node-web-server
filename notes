Middleware:
if express doesn't do something we want it to do then we can add a middleware and teach it to do so.
app.use((req, res, next) => {}); //registering middleware and it takes a function
we can make change to the request and the response object
we can use middleware to determine weather or not someone is logged in  and we can use it to respond to a request.
